# Building a Basic Text Generation Model with RNNs from Scratch

## Project Overview

This project is a deep dive into the basics of natural language processing and neural networks. It focuses on building a text generation model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) from scratch. 

This Python script leverages TensorFlow to structure a simple, yet effective, model capable of generating text after learning from a given dataset.

## About the Project

The core of this project is a Python script that outlines the step-by-step process of creating a text generation model. 

It encompasses several classes, each responsible for different aspects of the model creation process, including data preparation, model training, and text generation. 

The project demonstrates the application of TensorFlow in developing a model that learns from text data to generate new, similar texts.

### Key Components:

- `TextData`: Prepares and vectorizes text data.
- `TrainingDataGenerator`: Creates training datasets.
- `TextGenerationModel`: Defines the RNN model architecture.
- `ModelTrainer`: Manages the training process.
- `TextGenerator`: Generates new text based on the learned model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you meet the prerequisites listed below.

```
git clone https://github.com/Majid-Dev786/Building-a-basic-Text-Generation-Model-with-RNNs-from-Scratch.git
```

## Usage in Real World Scenarios

This text generation model can be applied in various real-world scenarios such as:
- Automated story or content creation
- Generating text-based data for training other models
- Assisting creative writing processes
- Enhancing chatbot responses

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x

Ensure you have the above prerequisites installed and properly set up in your development environment before proceeding.

## Installation

To set up the project environment and run the script, follow these steps:

1. Install TensorFlow:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
```
python Building a basic Text Generation Model with RNNs from Scratch.py
```

By following the above guidelines, you will be able to train the model and generate new text based on the input data provided to the `TextData` class.
